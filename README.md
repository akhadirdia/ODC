Application Description:
This web application is an electric load calculator designed to simplify the sizing and analysis of electrical requirements for the installation of charging stations. It enables detailed calculations based on input electrical data and the specifications of the charging stations.

Key Features:
Input Electrical Data:
Input the characteristics of the existing electrical setup: voltage, electrical current, types of transformers and disconnectors, power demand, and protections.
Option to define the configuration as single-phase or three-phase.
Fields to enter the visit date and the name of the responsible person.

Charging Station Information:
Input the specifications of the charging stations to be installed, with options for different levels and power ratings (e.g., 7.2 kW, 19.2 kW, 24 kW, etc.).
Ability to import a file containing charging station data.

Load Calculation Results:
Generation of detailed results, including:
Available power and current for transformers and disconnectors.
Residual current after accounting for charging stations.
Analysis methods based on power demand or equipment.

Transformer Sizing:
Automatic calculation of the required power and current for transformers based on the level of the charging station (Level 2 at 240 V or Level 3 at 480 V).
Assessment of additional electrical input needs.

Downloadable Results:
The load calculation results and charging station data can be exported as a downloadable report.
